# GitHub Folder Structure for Investment Portfolio Manager Application Documentation

The documentation for the Investment Portfolio Manager application, built using microservices, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), and Functional Programming (FP), is organized as Markdown files in a GitHub repository. The folder structure is designed to be intuitive, scalable, and aligned with the system’s modular architecture, facilitating access for developers, architects, and stakeholders. Below is the proposed folder structure, starting from the root directory, with descriptions of each directory and key files.

- **`non_functional_requirements.md`**: Focuses on scalability, security, reliability, and performance requirements.

#### `architecture/`
- **`overview.md`**: Provides a high-level overview of the system architecture, including microservices, DDD, EDA, and FP principles.
- **`microservices/`**: Contains one Markdown file per microservice (e.g., `portfolio_management_service.md`), detailing its responsibilities, domain model, and interactions.
- **`domain_driven_design/`**:
  - **`bounded_contexts.md`**: Defines each bounded context and its scope.
  - **`ubiquitous_language.md`**: Documents the shared terminology used across the system.
  - **`domain_events.md`**: Lists key domain events (e.g., "TradeExecuted") and their triggers.

## Rationale for the Structure
- **Logical Grouping**: The `docs/` directory is organized by functional areas (requirements, architecture, etc.) to align with the system’s development lifecycle.
- **Scalability**: Subdirectories like `microservices/` and `assets/` allow for easy addition of new files as the system evolves.
- **Collaboration**: GitHub-specific files (e.g., `CONTRIBUTING.md`, issue templates) streamline community contributions.
- **Clarity**: Descriptive file names (e.g., `portfolio_management_service.md`) and a clear hierarchy improve navigation.
- **Alignment with Architecture**: The structure reflects the microservices and DDD approach, with dedicated sections for each service and domain concept.

## Best Practices for GitHub Management
- **Use Branches**: Maintain a `main` branch for production-ready documentation and feature branches for ongoing changes.
- **Enable GitHub Pages**: Host the documentation as a static site using GitHub Pages for easy access.
- **Automate Validation**: Use CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions) to validate Markdown syntax and links.
- **Encourage Contributions**: Promote community contributions through clear guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Summary
This folder structure organizes the Investment Portfolio Manager application’s documentation into a clear, modular, and scalable hierarchy. It supports the microservices, DDD, EDA, and FP design by providing dedicated sections for each architectural component and ensures accessibility for developers, architects, and stakeholders. The structure leverages GitHub’s features for collaboration and maintenance, making it an effective documentation hub for the project.
