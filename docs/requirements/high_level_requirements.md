# High-Level Requirements for an Investment Portfolio Manager Application

As an experienced domain specialist in Investment Portfolio Management, I have outlined a comprehensive set of high-level requirements for an Investment Portfolio Manager application. These requirements address the needs of individual investors, financial advisors, and institutional clients, ensuring the application is robust, scalable, and capable of handling global investments and diverse asset classes. The requirements are organized into eight key areas: core functionalities, global investment handling, asset class management, risk management, reporting and analytics, external system integration, user management, and non-functional attributes.

## 1. Core Functionalities

The application must provide essential features to manage investment portfolios effectively, ensuring usability and accuracy for all users.

- **Asset Tracking**: Record and update holdings across various asset classes, including equities, fixed income, mutual funds, ETFs, real estate, commodities, and alternative investments. Capture transaction details (e.g., buy/sell orders), holdings, and corporate actions (e.g., stock splits, dividends).
- **Valuation**: Calculate the current portfolio value using real-time or near-real-time market prices, aggregated across all holdings and accounts.
- **Performance Calculation**: Compute returns, such as total return and time-weighted return, and compare performance against benchmarks like the S&P 500 or MSCI World. Support for GIPS (Global Investment Performance Standards) compliance is critical for institutional clients to ensure standardized performance reporting.

## 2. Handling Global Investments

To support global investments, the application must address multi-currency operations, international tax complexities, and diverse regulatory frameworks.

- **Multi-Currency Support**: Handle transactions, reporting, and valuation in multiple currencies with real-time exchange rate conversions. Support currency swaps and derivatives to mitigate exchange rate risks. For example, the system should allow users to view portfolio values in USD, EUR, or other currencies, with automatic updates based on market rates.
- **International Tax Implications**: Provide tools for calculating taxes across jurisdictions, supporting formats like IRS Form 1099 in the US or equivalent filings in other countries. The system should allow configurable tax rules to accommodate varying tax laws, potentially integrating with tax software for seamless reporting.
- **Diverse Regulatory Frameworks**: Ensure compliance with international regulations, such as MiFID II in Europe, Dodd-Frank in the US, or SEBI regulations in India. The application must generate regulatory reports and support compliance checks like KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering).

## 3. Managing Various Asset Classes

The application must accommodate the unique data and analytical requirements for different asset classes to provide accurate insights and management capabilities.

| **Asset Class** | **Data Requirements** | **Analytical Requirements** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Equities | Stock prices, dividends, corporate actions (e.g., splits, mergers) | Price trends, dividend yield, volatility |
| Fixed Income | Bond prices, coupon payments, maturity dates, credit ratings | Yield-to-maturity, duration, credit risk analysis |
| Mutual Funds/ETFs | Net Asset Value (NAV), distributions, fund holdings | Performance tracking, expense ratios, sector exposure |
| Real Estate | Property values, rental income, expenses, depreciation | Cash flow analysis, cap rates, property valuation |
| Commodities | Spot prices, futures contracts, storage costs | Price volatility, futures curve analysis |
| Alternative Investments | Fund performance data, capital calls, illiquidity schedules, valuation estimates | IRR calculations, risk-adjusted returns, liquidity risk |

## 4. Risk Management

Comprehensive risk management features are essential to minimize portfolio risks and ensure regulatory compliance.

- **Portfolio Diversification Analysis**: Calculate asset correlations, beta, and standard deviation to assess diversification. Provide visualizations (e.g., correlation matrices) to help users understand risk exposures across asset classes and geographies.
- **Stress Testing**: Support scenario analysis and Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate portfolio performance under adverse market conditions, such as market crashes or interest rate spikes.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure adherence to risk-related regulations, including capital adequacy requirements and position limits. Integrate with regulatory reporting systems to streamline compliance processes.

## 5. Reporting and Analytical Capabilities

The application must offer advanced reporting and analytics to support decision-making and compliance.

- **Performance Attribution**: Break down returns into components like asset allocation, security selection, and market timing to provide insights into performance drivers.
- **Tax Reporting**: Generate reports for capital gains/losses, wash sales, and straddles, with support for exporting data in formats required by tax authorities in different jurisdictions.
- **Capital Gains/Losses Tracking**: Maintain detailed transaction histories with lot-level tracking (e.g., FIFO, LIFO, or tax-efficient methods) to optimize tax outcomes.
- **Customizable Dashboards**: Allow users to create role-specific dashboards displaying key performance indicators (KPIs), such as portfolio value, risk metrics, and performance trends. Dashboards should be configurable for different user types (e.g., advisors vs. investors).

## 6. Integration with External Systems

Seamless integration with external systems ensures real-time data access and efficient transaction processing.

- **Market Data Providers**: Connect with providers like Bloomberg, Reuters, or Quandl for real-time quotes, news, and economic data to support valuation and decision-making.
- **Custodians**: Aggregate account data from custodians like State Street, BNY Mellon, or local custodians to provide a unified view of holdings.
- **Brokers**: Interface with brokerage platforms for trade execution and order management, supporting over 1,000 brokerages for broad compatibility.
- **Banking Platforms**: Integrate with banks for cash management and payment processing, ensuring smooth handling of cash flows and dividends.
- **Real-Time Data Feeds**: Support APIs for real-time market data, exchange rates, and transaction processing to keep the system up-to-date.

## 7. User Management and Access Control

The application must support diverse user roles with secure access controls to protect sensitive financial data.

- **User Roles**: Support individual investors, financial advisors, and institutional clients, each with tailored functionalities and access levels.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define permissions based on roles (e.g., advisors can view but not edit client portfolios, while administrators can manage user accounts).
- **Secure Authentication**: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and encryption to secure access to sensitive data, ensuring compliance with standards like GDPR.

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements ensure the application is scalable, secure, and reliable.

- **Scalability**: Handle large portfolios with thousands of holdings and high user volumes without performance degradation, using cloud-based or distributed architectures.
- **Data Security**: Encrypt sensitive data, comply with security standards (e.g., PCI DSS, GDPR), and ensure secure data transmission to protect user information.
- **Audit Trails**: Log all transactions, changes, and user actions for compliance and troubleshooting, maintaining a comprehensive audit history.
- **System Reliability**: Achieve high availability (e.g., 99.9% uptime) with disaster recovery plans and regular backups to ensure continuous operation.

## Additional Considerations

- **GIPS Compliance**: Support GIPS-compliant reporting for institutional clients, including composite construction and performance presentation standards.
- **Customization**: Allow configurable workflows, reporting templates, and data fields to meet the unique needs of different users.
- **Mobile Accessibility**: Provide a mobile-friendly interface for users to access portfolios on the go, with responsive design for various devices.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Support integration with third-party tools like tax software, CRM systems, or financial planning platforms to enhance functionality.
- Summary

The Investment Portfolio Manager application must provide a robust, scalable, and secure platform to manage diverse portfolios for individual and institutional users. By incorporating core functionalities, global investment support, asset class-specific features, risk management tools, advanced reporting, seamless integrations, secure user management, and strong non-functional attributes, the application can meet the complex needs of modern investment management. These requirements are informed by industry standards and best practices, ensuring a comprehensive solution for portfolio management.
