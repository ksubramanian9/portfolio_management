# Finalized Technology Stack for Investment Portfolio Manager Application (Scala)

The technology stack for the Investment Portfolio Manager application uses **Scala** as the primary programming language, leveraging its functional programming (FP), concurrency, and scalability features to support microservices, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), and FP paradigms. This stack is designed to handle global investments, diverse asset classes, real-time data processing, and regulatory compliance, while meeting non-functional requirements: **scalability**, **security**, **reliability**, **performance**, and **maintainability**. Scala’s proven use in large-scale applications like Apache Kafka and Twitter ensures its suitability for this financial system. Below is the finalized stack, organized by component, with justifications and alignment with requirements.

## Technology Stack Overview

### 1. Programming Language
- **Scala**
  - **Why**: Scala combines functional and object-oriented programming, offering immutable data structures, pure functions, and strong type safety, ideal for FP and financial computations. Its concurrency model (via Akka) supports EDA, and its interoperability with Java libraries ensures access to a vast ecosystem. Scala's use in Apache Kafka and Twitter demonstrates its capability for high-performance, distributed systems.
  - **Use Case**: Core business logic for microservices (e.g., Portfolio Management, Performance Calculation, Risk Management).
  - **Example** (Portfolio update in Scala):
    ```scala
    case class Portfolio(id: String, assets: List[Asset])
    def updatePortfolio(portfolio: Portfolio, trade: Trade): Portfolio = {
      val updatedAssets = trade match {
        case Buy(asset, quantity) => portfolio.assets :+ asset.copy(quantity = quantity)
        case Sell(assetId, quantity) => portfolio.assets.filterNot(_.id == assetId)
      }
      Portfolio(portfolio.id, updatedAssets)
    }
    ```
- **Non-Functional Alignment**:
  - **Scalability**: Akka’s actor model handles high transaction volumes.

  - **Use Case**: Implementing microservices like Portfolio Management, Transaction Management, and Risk Management.
  - **Alternative**: **Lagom** (Scala-based, built on Akka) for a more opinionated microservices framework with built-in persistence and event sourcing.
- **Non-Functional Alignment**:
  - **Scalability**: Akka distributes workloads across actors.
  - **Reliability**: Fault isolation via actor supervision.
  - **Performance**: Low-latency processing for real-time operations.
  - **Maintainability**: Modular design simplifies updates.

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Apache Kafka**
  - **Why**: Kafka is a high-throughput, distributed messaging system for EDA, supporting event publishing and subscribing (e.g., "TradeExecuted," "PriceUpdated"). It integrates with Akka Streams and ensures fault tolerance, widely used in financial systems (e.g., Kafka’s own implementation).
  - **Use Case**: Handling real-time events like trade executions, market price updates, and portfolio changes.
  - **Alternative**: **RabbitMQ** for simpler messaging needs with lower complexity.
- **Non-Functional Alignment**:
